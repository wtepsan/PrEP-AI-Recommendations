## Abstract
Background: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent HIV infection among high-risk populations, marks a major breakthrough in HIV prevention. Despite its clinical effectiveness, PrEP uptake and adherence remain limited due to multiple barriers, including lack of awareness, fear of side effects, social stigma, and insufficient healthcare access. Objective: This study aims to design and evaluate an integrated artificial intelligence (AI) framework that leverages machine learning (ML) and generative AI (Gen AI) to enhance PrEP uptake and adherence through personalized risk assessment and adaptive communication. Methods: A dataset of 2,000 client profiles was collected from Love2Test.org using a PrEP screening questionnaire based on CDC guidelines. Profiles were labeled as low or high HIV risk by domain experts. Multiple machine learning classifiers were trained using PyCaret AutoML and the best-performing model was selected based on ML evaluation metrics. The selected ML model was inte-grated with a generative AI model through a prompting mechanism to provide per-sonalized, context-aware PrEP recommendations. The framework was evaluated and validated through structured clinical face validity and content evaluation by four inde-pendent medical doctors. Results: Findings demonstrate that the integrated framework improves prediction accuracy and supports data-driven, context-aware communication. The AI-assisted recommendations effectively address user concerns, reduce perceived stigma, and enhance engagement, indicating strong potential for real-world clinical deployment. Conclusions: By combining predictive analytics with generative commu-nication, the framework provides a scalable, intelligent solution to improve PrEP uptake and adherence. This approach supports healthcare providers in optimizing resource al-location and strengthens the global HIV prevention effort through personalized, stig-ma-sensitive digital interventions.
