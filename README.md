# Abstract
## Background:
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent HIV infection among high-risk populations, marks a major breakthrough in HIV prevention. Despite its clinical effectiveness, PrEP uptake and adherence remain limited due to multiple barriers, including lack of awareness, fear of side effects, social stigma, and insufficient healthcare access.
Objective:
This study aims to design and evaluate an integrated artificial intelligence (AI) framework that leverages machine learning (ML) and generative AI (Gen AI) to enhance PrEP uptake and adherence through personalized risk assessment and adaptive communication.
## Method:
A dataset of 2,000 client profiles was generated using a PrEP screening questionnaire based on CDC guidelines and was labeled as low or high HIV risk by domain experts. Multiple machine learning classifiers were trained using PyCaret AutoML and the best-performing model was selected based on ML evaluation metrics. The selected ML model was integrated with a generative AI model through a prompting mechanism to provide personalized, context-aware PrEP recommendations. The framework was evaluated and validated through professional opinion scoring by four independent medical doctors.
## Result:
Findings demonstrate that the integrated framework improves prediction accuracy and supports data-driven, context-aware communication. The AI-assisted recommendations effectively address user concerns, reduce perceived stigma, and enhance engagement, indicating strong potential for real-world clinical deployment.
## Conclusion:
By combining predictive analytics with generative communication, the framework provides a scalable, intelligent solution to improve PrEP uptake and adherence. This approach supports healthcare providers in optimizing resource allocation and strengthens the global HIV prevention effort through personalized, stigma-sensitive digital interventions.
