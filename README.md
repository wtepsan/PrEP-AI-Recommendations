## Abstract
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)—the use of antiretroviral medication to prevent HIV infection in high-risk individuals—represents a major advancement in HIV prevention. Yet despite its proven efficacy, PrEP uptake and adherence remain suboptimal. Several factors contribute to this issue, ranging from individual barriers, such as limited awareness and fear of side effects, to interpersonal challenges, including stigma and lack of social support. Additionally, broader structural obstacles, such as community stigma, restricted access to services, and healthcare workforce shortages, further hinder its widespread adoption. These multifaceted hurdles underscore the need for innovative solutions beyond traditional public health approaches. In this context, advanced machine learning (ML) and generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) tools offer a transformative means to address these barriers. ML enables refined risk stratification by integrating demographic, behavioral, and clinical data, while Gen AI delivers tailored outreach and education—mitigating stigma and addressing concerns through precise, adaptive communication. To harness these capabilities, this study develops and evaluates an integrated framework that combines ML-based risk prediction with Gen AI–driven recommendations. The framework’s accuracy, reliability, and clinical applicability are rigorously assessed through empirical data analyses and expert reviews, demonstrating its potential to empower healthcare providers with interpretable, data-driven insights. By streamlining resource allocation, enhancing patient engagement, and fostering personalized care, this integrative approach aims to substantially improve PrEP uptake and adherence—ultimately reinforcing the global fight against HIV.
