# PrEP-AI-Recommendations
![My Local Image](/images/framework.png)


## Abstract
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a critical strategy for HIV prevention, yet the identification of high-risk individuals remains challenging due to constrained healthcare resources and rising patient demand. This study proposes an innovative framework that integrates machine learning (ML) and generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) to optimize PrEP recommendations. The framework employs ML models trained on diverse client profile data—encompassing demographic, behavioral, and clinical variables—to generate targeted recommendations, while Gen AI leverages medical guidelines to enhance decision-making support. Evaluation through empirical data analysis and expert reviews ensures the framework’s accuracy, reliability, and clinical applicability. By providing interpretable, data-driven tools for healthcare practitioners, this approach has the potential to improve PrEP decision-making, broaden access to preventive care, and strengthen HIV prevention strategies, ultimately addressing the global challenge of HIV transmission more effectively.
