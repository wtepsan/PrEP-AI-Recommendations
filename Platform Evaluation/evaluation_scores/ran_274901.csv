However, feel free to discuss it with your healthcare provider.","**Explanation**: You were categorized as low to moderate risk due to a combination of safe and unsafe factors. On the safe side, you have not been sexually active in the last six months, which reduces your immediate risk of sexual transmission of HIV. Additionally, your sexual partners are female and non-binary, and you do not engage in multiple sexual partnerships, which further lowers your sexual transmission risk. However, there are some unsafe factors to consider: you sometimes use condoms, do not discuss STI/HIV prevention with partners, and do not know your partners' HIV status, which could potentially increase your risk if you become sexually active again. Importantly, you have a history of injecting drugs, which is a significant risk factor for HIV, especially if needles or equipment are shared. The ML model suggests that PrEP may not be necessary given your current low to moderate risk, but your history of injecting drugs and the potential for future sexual activity with unknown risk partners could warrant further discussion about PrEP with a healthcare provider to ensure comprehensive protection against HIV.",3,3,3,3,Injecting drug should be an indication for PrEP.
