The ML model strongly recommends PrEP, which aligns with your behavioral risk factors. Although you report no sexual activity in the last six months and no multiple sexual partners, there are significant concerns regarding your STI diagnosis within the last six months, which indicates recent exposure to sexual health risks.

These factors suggest potential exposure to HIV through past sexual activities.
